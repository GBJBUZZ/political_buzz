# 🚀 Deployment Guide for Hostinger

Your app is built and ready! Since it uses a **Database (SQLite)** and **API Routes**, it must run as a **Node.js Application**.

## ✅ Prerequisite
You must use **Hostinger VPS** or **Hostinger Cloud** with **Node.js** support.
*(Standard shared "Web Hosting" might not support running a persistent Node.js server with SQLite easily).*

---

## 📦 Step 1: Prepare Files
You need to upload these specific files/folders to your server (e.g., via File Manager or SCP/FTP):

1. **`.next`** (folder) - *Generated by `npm run build`*
2. **`public`** (folder) - *Images & assets*
3. **`prisma`** (folder) - *Contains `dev.db` (your database)*
4. **`package.json`**
5. **`package-lock.json`**
6. **`next.config.mjs`**
7. **`.env`** - *Contains your configs*

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Do NOT upload `node_modules`. You will install them on the server.

---

## 🛠️ Step 2: Install Dependencies on Server
Once files are uploaded, open the **Terminal** (SSH) on Hostinger and run:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/app
npm install --production --force
```

This installs only the packages needed to run the app.

---

## 🗄️ Step 3: Setup Database
Run this command on the server to ensure the Prisma client is ready:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

*(Your `dev.db` file should already be in the `prisma/` folder you uploaded)*

---

## 🚀 Step 4: Start the App
Use **PM2** (Process Manager) to keep your app running 24/7.

```bash
# Install PM2 (if not installed)
npm install -g pm2

# Start the app
pm2 start npm --name "political-buzz" -- start
```

Your app is now running on **port 3000**!

---

## 🌐 Step 5: Connect Domain (Nginx/Apache)
Hostinger usually handles this, but if you need to point your domain to the running app, you might need a Reverse Proxy.

**Nginx Example:**
```nginx
location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
}
```

---

## 🔄 Updating the App
When you make changes locally:
1. Run `npm run build` locally.
2. Upload the new `.next` folder.
3. Restart the server:
   ```bash
   pm2 restart political-buzz
   ```
