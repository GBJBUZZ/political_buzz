# ✅ Tasks Completed

### 1. 🏠 Homepage Restored
I have fully restored your **Agency Homepage** (`/`) with all the original sections:
-   Hero & Trust Bar
-   Services Grid
-   Case Studies & Testimonials
-   Social Proof & How We Work
-   Insights & CTA

It now looks exactly like the professional agency site it was before.

### 2. 📊 Political Connect Platform (Real Data)
I have moved the platform to: **`/political-connect`**

**Improvements:**
-   **Real Database Connection**:
    -   **City Stats**: Now displays real counts of Representatives and Parties from your SQLite database.
    -   **Party Index**: Fetches actual party names (BJP, INC, etc.) from the DB.
    -   **Representative Spotlight**: Displays real candidates (Rajesh Kadam, etc.) seeded in your database.
-   **Clean "Instagram-like" UI**:
    -   Simplified cards.
    -   Removed clutter.
    -   Focus on visual content and data.

### 🚀 How to View:

1.  **Agency Site**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2.  **Platform App**: [http://localhost:3000/political-connect](http://localhost:3000/political-connect)
