# ✅ Political Connect 2.0 Ready

I have connected the **Political Connect** dashboard to the main navigation and upgraded it to a full **Real-Time Web App**.

### 🌟 New "Instagram-Style" Features:
1.  **Clickable Profiles**: Click any candidate card to open a **Detailed Profile Modal**.
    *   See "Issues Resolved", "Trust Score", and "Follower Count" at a glance.
    *   Direct links to their social profiles.
2.  **Live Data Stream**: The dashboard now auto-refreshes every 30 seconds.
    *   Status indicator shows **"LIVE DATA"** (Green Pulse).
3.  **Seamless Navigation**:
    *   Updated the Main Homepage Header: **"Social Connect"** -> **"Political Connect"**.
    *   Clicking it takes you straight to the dashboard.

### 🚀 How to Test:
1.  **Go to Home**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
2.  **Click "Political Connect"** in the top menu.
3.  **Click on any Candidate** to see their full profile overlay.

The app is now fully integrated and pro-grade. 🚀
