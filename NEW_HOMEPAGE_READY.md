# ✅ Political Connect Homepage Implementation

I have completely overhauled the homepage (`/`) to match the **10-point "Political Connect" vision**.

### 🏗️ New Sections Built:

1.  **HERO SECTION**: "India’s First Political Connect Platform". No login wall. Visual map on the right.
2.  **LOCATION PICKER**: "Find Your Local Community". Smart dropdowns for State > City > Ward. Includes "Auto-detect".
3.  **CITY SNAPSHOT**: "Nagpur Snapshot". 4 Brutal Truth cards (Representatives, Active Profiles, Top Parties, Active Issues).
4.  **PARTY COMPARISON**: "Party Performance Index". Validated data styling (Reach, Digital, Response Rate). No opinions.
5.  **WARD HEATMAP**: Interactive grid of 38 wards. Clicking shows "Top Issues" and "Last Response".
6.  **LIVE ISSUES FEED**: Real-time ticker of issues (Water, Roads) with status (Pending/Resolved).
7.  **REPRESENTATIVE SPOTLIGHT**: "Accountability Section". Cards showing Response Rate & Resolution Score.
8.  **WHY POLITICAL CONNECT**: Trust builder. "Not a party platform. Not news."
9.  **CALL TO ACTION**: "Join Your Ward Community".
10. **FOOTER**: Updated with **Neutrality Statement** and **Data Sources Disclaimer**.

### 🎨 Design Aesthetic:
-   **Brand Colors**: Navy Blue, Gold, Teal.
-   **Style**: Professional, Data-First, Clean.
-   **Interactivity**: Hover effects, smooth animations (framer-motion).

### 🚀 How to View:
1.  **Restart Server** (if you haven't already):
    ```powershell
    npm run dev
    ```
2.  Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

You will see the complete new platform homepage!
